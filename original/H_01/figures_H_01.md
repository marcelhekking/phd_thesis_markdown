Figure 1--1. Areas of acid-base classification according to the method
presented in Error: Reference source not found. Combinations of low,
high or normal observed values yield 12 specific acid-base disorder
regions. In the normal region, all values are within their standard 95%
normal reference intervals. The 'x' regions are formally not
classifiable \[34\]. In these regions, one of the three observed
acid-base values is outside its 95% univariate reference interval
