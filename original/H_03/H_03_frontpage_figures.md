Figure 3--1. Original acid-base axes, projected on the PC1-PC2 subspaces
for data sets AZRbe (left) and OLVGbe (right). The placement of the
original acid-base axes is different as a result of different
covariances in the original distributions.

Figure 3--2. The angle Î± between the projected original pH-axis and the
PC1-axis in the PC1-PC2 subspace of data set AZRbe.

Figure 3--3. Intersection of a PC1-PC2 subspace with a 95% univariate
reference cube. Arrows point into the direction of increasing values.

Figure 3--4. The proposed chart for pH, PaCO~2~ and
a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\], as built from the data in the ELIab data set.

Figure 3--5. The proposed chart for pH, PaCO~2~ and BE as built from the
data in the ELIbe data set. The classical acid-base classification from
Error: Reference source not found are plotted in (dotted lines).

Figure 3--6. The ELIbe chart with the new vector classification scheme
plotted in (dotted lines).
