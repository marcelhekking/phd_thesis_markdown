## Introduction

Numerous methods, nomograms, charts and graphics for the representation
and evaluation of the primary acid-base variables have been developed
since Henderson first demonstrated the importance of the
a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\]/CO~2~ buffer system for the acid-base
equilibrium in human blood \[1-7\]. In 1921, Van Slyke published one of
the first acid-base charts which was a plot of the bicarbonate-ion
($\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) concentration versus the pH of blood \[8\]. Later
he altered this chart by adding iso-carbon-dioxide (CO~2~) lines \[9\].
In 1931, Peters and Van Slyke published a plot in which the logarithm of
the total plasma CO~2~ content was plotted against the logarithm of the
CO~2~ tension. Many other charts developed since then are merely
variations on the original acid-base charts introduced by Van Slyke.

In the 1950's, Davenport popularised the plot of the arterial
bicarbonate-ion concentration (a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\]) versus pH with
curved isopleths of partial pressures of carbon-dioxide in arterial
blood (PaCO~2~) for the representation and evaluation of acid-base
disorders \[10\]. The 'followers' of the in vivo approach (see Chapter
Error: Reference source not found) mainly use this type of chart. When
in 1960 Astrup and Siggaard-Andersen developed the concept of the base
excess (BE) and the accompanying classification scheme, they proposed a
chart for the representation of pH, PaCO~2~ and BE values. The
Siggaard-Andersen chart is a plot of logarithmic PaCO~2~ versus pH in
which equal BE values are represented by straight isopleths running form
north-west to south-east \[11, 12\].

However, a major disadvantage of most acid-base representations, whether
based on BE or a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\], is that they try to represent
three variables with only two coordinates. Representing three variables
in only two dimensions leads to the phenomenon that equal changes in the
acid-base status as measured with the three acid-base variables may not
be displayed as equal distances in such a two-dimensional
representation. These charts are therefore less suitable for the
representation of consecutive acid-base observations from a single
patient. As Siggaard-Andersen observed of his own chart: 'A major
disadvantage of the chart is that the rate of changes is not easily
visualised' \[12\].

To be useful in critical care situations, where serial analyses and
interpretations of arterial blood gas values are crucial, an acid-base
chart should represent all three acid-base variables in such a way that
changes in any direction can be equally appreciated. Ideally, a
graphical representation of three acid-base variables allowing the
clinician to monitor the acid-base status over time would require the
use of three-dimensional graphical software with options of on-line
rotation. It is unlikely that a clinician will use such software in a
clinical setting.

In this chapter, a standardised way is proposed, based on the data
reduction method introduced in the preceding chapter, to represent pH,
PaCO~2~ and a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\]/BE values in a two-dimensional
chart exploiting their intrinsic two-dimensionality. The method allows a
faithful graphical representation of all three basic acid-base variables
in two dimensions. Moreover, for pH, PaCO~2~ and BE values, a new way of
classifying acid-base disorders is presented as a solution to the
problem of 'unclassifiable' classes that occurs when classifying
acid-base observations according to the Astrup and Siggaard-Andersen
method as described in Chapter Error: Reference source not found.

## Methods

### Construction of the chart

In the preceding chapter it was demonstrated that a standard
mathematical transformation procedure called principal component
analysis (PCA) of a trivariate acid-base data set results in a
distribution of principal component values PC1 and PC2 that has almost
the same information content as the original acid-base data set. Hence,
the plane spanned by the PC1 and PC2 axes after PCA ensures a graphical
representation of the complete acid-base status in two dimensions
without significant loss of information. However, according to the
definition of PCA, principal components are always uncorrelated \[13\].
This means that the projection of the original acid-base axes in the
PC1-PC2 subspace is entirely dependent on the observed covariances in
the original acid-base data set. As a result, PC1-PC2 subspaces of
various PCA transformed acid-base data sets are not comparable. Figure 3
--1 illustrates this by showing two PCA transformed trivariate acid-base
distributions from the preceding chapters; *AZRbe* and *OLVGbe*. The
original acid-base axes are projected onto the plane spanned by PC1 and
PC2. It can be clearly seen that the projection of the original
acid-base axes is different for the two data sets.

To obtain a standard appearance of the PC1-PC2 subspace, an extra
rotation in this plane is added in such a way that the original pH-axis
is always presented horizontally with low pH values on the left and
increasing values on the right. To do so, the eigenmatrix U of Chapter
Error: Reference source not found is multiplied by a rotation matrix,
yielding a final transformation
matrix T;!

$T = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{cos}\ \alpha & \text{sin}\ \alpha & 0 \\
 - \text{sin}\ \alpha & \text{cos}\ \alpha & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}\text{*U}$, (3--1)

in which α is the angle between the projected original pH-axis and the
PC1-axis line in the PC1-PC2 subspace (see Figure 3 --2 for an example).
The transformation matrix T calculates rotated PC1 and PC2 values
(hereafter referred to as PC1\' and PC2\') from original standardised
acid-base values. PC1\' and PC2\' values are in fact the coordinate
values of the acid-base observation in the proposed acid-base

Having found the final transformation matrix T, the outlines of the
acid-base chart can now be drawn. First, original acid-base axes are
drawn into the chart as follows. Since the acid-base data set is
standardised (see Equation Error: Reference source not found), each
acid-base axis in the original coordinate system can be represented by a
unit vector. For example, the unit vector representing the positive
PaCO~2~-axis (values ≥ 40 mmHg) is
$\left\lbrack \text{010} \right\rbrack$ since this vector points into
the direction of equal pH (first element of the unit vector is 0),
positive PaCO~2~ (second element is 1) and equal BE or
a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\] (third element is 0). Multiplying this vector
by matrix T yields PC1\' and PC2\' values that indicate the exact
direction of the unit vector representing the positive PaCO~2~-axis in
the proposed chart. This procedure is performed for the three original
acid-base axes. Then, the standard 95% univariate reference intervals
(see Error: Reference source not found) are drawn into the chart. In
three dimensions, the univariate intervals of the three acid-base
variables form a 95% univariate reference cube. Figure 3 --3 shows the
intersection of a PC1-PC2 subspace with such a 95% univariate reference
cube. Each side of the reference cube corresponds to a standard 95%
lower upper cut-off value or upper cut-off value. Since the cube is
represented in a standardised measurement space, and a 95% univariate
interval is defined as *m* ± 2*s*, each side has a value of -2 (lower
cut-off value) or 2 (upper cut-off value). For each of the six
intersection points (points 11, 8, 4, 10, 5, 1 in Figure 3 --3), two of
the three cut-off values are known. For example, point 11 is located on
the side representing the 95% lower cut-off value for pH, on the side
representing the 95% upper cut-off value for PaCO~2~ but between the
sides representing the upper- and lower cut-off values for the metabolic
parameter. Let x, y and z be the 95% cut-off values for respectively pH,
PaCO~2~ and the metabolic parameter. Since principal components are
orthogonal and the three variables are assumed to be linearly related,
the third principal component value (PC3) must be 0 \[13\];

e~31~ x + e~32~ y + e~33~ z = 0, (3--2)

where e~31~, e~32~ and e~33~ are the three elements of the normalised
eigenvector of the third principal component as listed in Error:
Reference source not found. With this equation, any third component of
each of the six intersection points can be calculated. An intersection
point must subsequently be multiplied by transformation matrix T to
obtain its exact location in the proposed chart. The six transformed
intersection points together yield the intersection with the 95%
reference cube in the proposed chart.

### Vectorial classification system for pH, PaCO~2~ and base excess values

As described in Chapter Error: Reference source not found, classifying
acid-base disorders according to the Astrup and Siggaard-Andersen method
is based on the simultaneous evaluation of observed pH, PaCO­~2~ and BE
values. A specific combination of observed values for the three
acid-base variables below, above or within their respective 95%
reference intervals corresponds to a specific acid-base disorder
classification (see Error: Reference source not found). However, the
existence of non-classifiable combinations is inherent to a systematic
use of these classification rules. As a solution to this problem,
Gelsema *et al* \[14\] proposed to represent each of the 12 acid-base
disturbances as used in the Astrup and Siggaard-Andersen classification
scheme with a specific disorder vector. For instance, in the
standardised measurement space, the unit vector
$\left\lbrack - \text{110} \right\rbrack$ represents a respiratory
acidosis (low pH, high PaCO~2~ and a normal BE).

This vectorial classification scheme can be made visible in the proposed
chart for pH, PaCO~2~ and BE values. Multiplying all 12 unit acid-base
disorder vectors by the transformation matrix T yield PC1\' and PC2\'
values that indicate the exact directions of the 12 disorder vectors in
the proposed chart. Determining all angles that a patient acid-base
vector makes with each of the 12 disorder vectors in the proposed chart
produces a classification. The acid-base disorder vector yielding the
smaller angle is subsequently used for the actual classification of the
observed patient acid-base values.

## Results

Figure 3 --4 shows the proposed chart for the *ELIab* data set. The
chart is based on the PCA transformation of 1500 pH, logarithmic PaCO~2~
and logarithmic a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\] values coming from patients of
the ICU of the St. Elisabeth hospital. The hexagon in the middle is the
two-dimensional representation of the standard 95% reference cube of
Error: Reference source not found. Note that the original acid-base axes
are no longer perpendicular as seen in other familiar acid-base charts.
In Figure 3 --4, the pH axis runs along the abscissa, while the PaCO~2~
and a\[$\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\] axes are placed at an angle close to 60°,
resulting in a tri-axial placement of the original acid-base axes.

It may be argued that in this tri-axial configuration, information on
the values of the original variables is lost. Indeed, the rotated
principal components PC1\' and PC2\' are linear combinations of the
original variables. Nevertheless, although the projected original
acid-base axes are no longer perpendicular, each condition as
represented by a point in the tri-axial chart may still be interpreted
in terms of the values of each of the original variables, by (mentally)
projecting the point perpendicularly onto the respective axes.

### The proposed chart for pH, PaCO~2~ and base excess values

Figure 3 --5 shows the proposed chart for the *ELIbe* data set. This
chart is based on 1500 pH, PaCO~2~ and BE values coming from patients of
the ICU of the St. Elisabeth hospital. The regions corresponding to the
12 acid-base disorders of the Astrup and Siggaard-Andersen
classification method are displayed. Based on this classification
scheme, four types of regions can be seen in the chart:

- All variables within their respective standard reference ranges.
  This is the standard 95% reference volume. In the chart, this volume
  appears as the hexagonal shaped figure at the centre of the chart.
- One variable outside its 95% univariate reference interval. These
  regions appear as triangles sharing one side with the standard
  normal region. There are six such regions, since each of the three
  variables may be outside its reference interval either at the high
  or at the low end. These regions are 'non-classifiable' in the
  classification method of Astrup and
  Siggaard-Andersen.
- Two variables outside their 95% univariate reference intervals.
  These appear as regions, each sharing only one point with the border
  of the standard normal region. There are six such regions, each
  touching a different point of the normal hexagon. The region '= + +'
  is such a region; it contains cases for which pH is within
  reference, PaCO~2~ and BE are outside, both at the high end.
  Depending on the history and status of the ICU patient, this region
  indicates either a fully compensated respiratory acidosis, a fully
  compensated metabolic alkalosis or a combined respiratory acidosis
  and metabolic alkalosis.
- All three variables are outside their 95% univariate reference
  interval. These appear as triangular regions with one side of the
  triangle in infinity and with no point in common with the border of
  the normal reference region. Again, there are six such regions. The
  region '+ + +' is one of these. It contains cases with all three
  variables outside their reference intervals at the high end: partly
  compensated metabolic alkalosis.

In Figure 3 --6, each of the 12 acid-base disorder regions of Figure 3
--5 is represented by a corresponding vector. The 12 vectors enable the
classification of acid-base disorders according to the method of Astrup
and Siggaard-Andersen without the disadvantage of having an
*unclassifiable* class. There are two types of
vectors:

\bcenter

![](figures/H_03_image6.png){width="65%"}

\ecenter

_Figure 3--6. The ELIbe chart with the new vector classification scheme plotted in (dotted lines)._

- Vectors that are (more or less) perpendicular to an original
  acid-base axis. There are six such vectors and they correspond to the regions in Figure 3 --5 that share only one point with the
  border of the standard normal region. Vector '‑ + =' is such a
  vector; it is almost perpendicular to the original BE axis and points towards low pH and high PaCO~2~ values. Hence, this vector represents a pure respiratory acidosis.

- Vectors that are between the above mentioned six vectors. They
  represent the triangular regions of Figure 3 --5 that have one side
  of the triangle in infinity and with no point in common with the
  border of the hexagon. There are six of these vectors. Vector
  '‑ + +' is such a vector. This vector points into the direction of
  low pH, high PaCO~2~ and high BE: a partially compensated
  respiratory acidosis.

## Discussion

Intensive care medicine of today is characterised by a voluminous
production of measured and calculated variables. Continuous monitoring
of vital signs, laboratory values and ventilator settings generates a
vast and never ending stream of data to be evaluated and interpreted by
ICU personnel. Since there is such an overload of information on the ICU
there is a great need to develop decision aids to enable ICU personnel
to become quickly orientated in the pathophysiological state of the
patients under their care \[15\].

The traditional method of communicating medical quantitative information
is the numerical display of data. However, a number of studies show that
the graphical representation of medical data greatly improves human
information processing. For instance, Cole found that the graphical
representation of ventilator data led to a faster interpretation of
these data as compared to the traditional numerical display, while
Elting demonstrated that the assimilation of information was
significantly faster and more accurate when time-dependent information
variables are displayed graphically rather than in a tabular manner
\[16, 17\]. In simulated sessions of anaesthesiology monitoring,
Gurushanthaia demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy and
speed in detecting changes in the values of physiologic variables when a
graphical display of the data was used rather than a textual one \[18\].

Numerical interfaces make the data, required to complete tasks of
diagnosing and classifying, available but often do not provide the
*information* necessary to support a physician in his decision making
\[19\]. The advantage of graphical displays over numerical
representations probably lies in the exploitation of the still
unsurpassed pattern recognition capabilities of the human mind. Regular
use of graphical displays by physicians may induce a learning effect so
that specific pathophysiological states of a patient are recognised in a
single glance. Because it is difficult for the clinician to memorise all
the data, especially the display of previous data together with the
current data is very useful in an intensive care setting \[20\].
Therefore, plotting consecutive data in charts and time trend plots may
be of high value in such a setting.

In this chapter, a two-dimensional chart is described for the
representation of trivariate acid-base data sets. The chart is useful
for the graphical monitoring of the acid-base status of a patient, since
acid-base changes between consecutive observations are faithfully
displayed. The rationale of the chart is based on multivariate
statistical principles.

Only after the development of this chart it was found that as early as
in 1931, Hastings and Steinhaus proposed a chart that has a striking
similarity to the one developed here \[21\]. This kind of acid-base
charting was mainly used in a research environment since analysing the
acid-base status of arterial blood was far from a routine process around
1930. Only a limited number of studies referred to the original
publication of Hastings and Steinhaus \[22-24\]. The Hastings and
Steinhaus acid-base chart gradually sank into oblivion, despite some
attempts to revive it \[25-27\]. The similarities of the Hastings and
Steinhaus chart with the chart described in this chapter and the
advantages of a tri-axially configured acid-base chart will be further
discussed in Chapter Error: Reference source not found.
